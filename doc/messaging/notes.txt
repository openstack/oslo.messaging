  - can_send_version() in RPCClient

  - we need some way for the dispatcher to take the incoming
    context dict and instantiate a user-supplied request context
    object with it

  - notifications!

  - @expose decorator

  - when shutting down a dispatcher, do we need to invoke
    a cleanup method on the listener?

  - ClientException - e.g. the executor should handle this being
    raised by the dispatcher

  - raising Timeout when a reply isn't received

  - the InvalidTarget checks seem like they're generic preconditions
    that all drivers would want enforced

  - _safe_log() logs sanitized message data

  - unique_id used to reject duplicate messages

  - local.store.context used by common logging - basically, how to make
    sure the context of the currently dispatching rpc is available to
    logging. Need to abstract out the dependency on eventlet for this.

  - the current rpc code dispatches each method in its own greenlet,
    we need to do the same in the eventlet executor

  - I'm not sure listener.done() is really needed - can't we ack the
    message before returning it from poll() ?

  - envelope=True/False really sucks - it's a transport driver specific
    flag and we're only using it to communicate whether to use the new
    or older on-the-wire notification message format. Maybe we should
    have a high-level "notification message format version" which each
    transport driver can map to an on-the-wire format. Meh.

Things I don't like:

  - CallContext - we already abuse the term "context" enough

  - There's something about using a context manager for prepare() that
    I like:

        with client.prepare(version='2.6') as cctxt:
            cctxt.call('select_host',
                       request_spec=request_spec,
                       filter_properties=filter_properties)

    but it seems a bit nonsensical

  - "endpoints" - better than api_objs, callbacks, proxyobj, etc.

  - we probably won't use BlockingRPCExecutor anywhere, but I think
    it does a good job of showing the basic job of a dispatcher
    implementation


There's a bunch of places where what fields are used in a target
is unclear:

  - in driver.listen() and server.start():
      - required: topic and server
      - optional: exchange
      - ignored: namespace, version, fanout

  - in dispatcher:
      - required: none
      - optional: namespace, version
      - ignored: exchange, topic, server, fanout

  - in driver.send():
      - required: topic
      - optional: server, fanout and exchange
      - ignored: namespace, version

  - in client.call() and client.cast():
      - required: (topic is required by send())
      - optional: namespace, version (server, fanout, exchange optional to send())
      - ignored: none

driver porting guide:

  - implement a BaseDriver subclass:

      - send() should be similar to call()/cast()
      - listen() should be similar to create_consumer()

  - implement a base.Listener subclass

      - poll() should pull a message off the queue
      - done() should ack it
