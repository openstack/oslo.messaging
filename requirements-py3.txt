# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order

# FIXME: concurrent.futures is part of the Python stdlib since Python 3.2,
# but the requirements is still needed because of a bug in tox:
# https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/tox/issue/236/tox-must-create-the-source-distribution
#
# Tox builds a source distribution with "python setup.py sdist" which uses
# requirements.txt even if tox wants to build the py34 virtual environment.
# As a consequence, oslo.messaging.egg_info/requires.txt contains futures
# and oslo_messaging.tests.test_opts.OptsTestCase.test_entry_point fails.
#
# for the futures based executor
futures>=3.0

# needed by the aioeventlet executor
aioeventlet>=0.4
trollius>=1.0
