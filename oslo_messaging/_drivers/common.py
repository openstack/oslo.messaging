'''RPC Envelope Version.

This version number applies to the top level structure of messages sent out.
It does *not* apply to the message payload, which must be versioned
independently.  For example, when using rpc APIs, a version number is applied
for changes to the API being exposed over rpc.  This version number is handled
in the rpc proxy and dispatcher modules.

This version number applies to the message envelope that is used in the
serialization done inside the rpc layer.  See serialize_msg() and
deserialize_msg().

The current message format (version 2.0) is very simple.  It is:

    {
        'oslo.version': <RPC Envelope Version as a String>,
        'oslo.message': <Application Message Payload, JSON encoded>
    }

Message format version '1.0' is just considered to be the messages we sent
without a message envelope.

So, the current message envelope just includes the envelope version.  It may
eventually contain additional information, such as a signature for the message
payload.

We will JSON encode the application message payload.  The message envelope,
which includes the JSON encoded application message body, will be passed down
to the messaging libraries as a dict.
